# TF_object_detection
Implementing TF Object Detection API for custom dataset. 

The inspiration of this repo is an active [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/global-wheat-detection) hosted by the University of Saskatchewan to design an Object Detection model to identify wheat heads. Because this is an active contest, I have not included the data or any of my TFRecord files, but rather the data can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/global-wheat-detection/data).
